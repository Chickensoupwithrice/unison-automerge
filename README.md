# unison-automerge

Building Automerge <-> File system, 2 way sync, that does not break git backed repositories.

Ideally, we can get this to the point that I can run a daemon that will keep my notes directory available as automerge documents, and edit them on the web, or locally, without any conflicts.

Ironically, various metadata is stored in an automerge document, that I'm scared to distribute due to vandalism. It is a prime candidate for replication using a working copy of this (as yet, hypothetical) software.
